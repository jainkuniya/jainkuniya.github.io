Traffic, Traffic, Traffic!
Are you facing problems with traffic?

- Worried about when to leave, to escape from traffic?
- Checking Google maps frequently to keep an eye on the traffic trend?

> Or should I just ask, are you living in Bangalore? Haha :wink:!

Then this is for you :)

[**Tafy**](http://bit.ly/tafy) - A simple chrome extension which can help you find best time to leave for your destination.


**Background:**
Recently I moved to Bangalore for my summer internship at [Goibibo](https://goibibo.com), where I witnessed the world famous traffic and people investing an hour on a daily basis by refreshing maps to find out best time to leave for their destination hence decided to develop this simple solution which won't fix the traffic condition but help you cope with it smarter way :D

Let's understand it with a real life example:

You are at your work and it is around ~7:30 PM. Fortunately this time you have completed all your work before time, your product delivery is out with no incident reported and your boss is extremely happy with it.

Now it's already time to go home, but as soon as you check the map, damn! it is hell lot of traffic.

> OMG! It is too much traffic and rain is pouring, let's wait and check again in another 5 mins.

At least for the next half an hour your primary job has shifted to checking the maps over and over again.

> You know what, you could have had played TT in that time :D How?

Let's take [Tafy's](http://bit.ly/tafy) help. Just turn it on, set the time duration which works for you, [Tafy](http://bit.ly/tafy) will automatically notify you the best time to start. Till then, you can carry on your work (Oh yes! you can play too :p), without needing to hit maps repeatedly.

[Tafy](http://bit.ly/tafy) is very light weight, it takes negligible RAM compared to map site/app which means, it just cozily sits there in your browser's top right corner without hampering any performance of your PC.

This was the brief overview of what I have built last week in the same category as of [Wimator](../wimator)

## Features of [Tafy](http://bit.ly/tafy)

- **Easy to setup**

  - Download [Tafy](http://bit.ly/tafy) from [chrome webstore](http://bit.ly/tafy).
  - Open [Google maps](http://bit.ly/v-maps)
  - Set your source and destination.
  - Click on directions.
  - See the magic.

  Now you can close the maps tab. [Tafy](http://bit.ly/tafy) is ready to do it's job.
  It will automatically update the travel time on it's badge.

- **Fully customizable**

  - **Get notified when travel time drops to your required time**

    Set the time duration in which you are ready to travel.

  - **Set your own custom text to be voiced in the notification**

    Yes! you heard it right :). [Tafy](http://bit.ly/tafy) will alert you with your own personalised message, when the time dips to your desired time.

  - **Add as many routes you want**

    Just search for directions on [Google maps](http://bit.ly/v-maps) and [Tafy](http://bit.ly/tafy) will automatically start tracking for your. In future you can easily select another destination without opening [Google maps](http://bit.ly/v-maps).

  - **Get travel time via all possible routes**

    Tap on [Tafy](http://bit.ly/tafy) icon in the extensions section on chrome and all the routes with distance and directions will be listed under the section of **Travel Route**.

  - **Set your travel mode**

    You can select your travel mode (driving, walking, cycling or transit). [Tafy](http://bit.ly/tafy) will fetch travel time according to it. Changing travel mode is too simple, just tap on respective radio buttons.

  - **Adjustable Refresh rate**

    It is the time interval in which travel time is updated from the server.
    If, in case, it's not urgent to leave, you can increase the refresh rate to reduce the load on server :sweat_smile:.
