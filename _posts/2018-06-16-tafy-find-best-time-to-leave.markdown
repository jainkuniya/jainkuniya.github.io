Holla! Glad that you came here :p

Are are facing problems with traffic? Worried about when to leave, to meet minimal traffic?Opening Google maps site/app frequently to keep an eye on traffic? Then this is for you :)

**Tafy** - Magical chrome extension which helps in finding best time to leave for the destination.

Let's understand it with a real life example:

You are sitting in a office and it is around ~7:30 PM. Fortunately this time you have completed all your work before time, and release is out with no bug reported till so far. And you boss is extremely happy with it.

Now it's already time to go home, but you want to impress him a bit more :p. So decided to jump on next task. But is not so urgent, you can leave office anytime.

Let's call Tafy in the picture. Turn on Tafy, set the time duration which you can tolerate in the traffic and all set to focus on work.

As soon as journey time to your destination drops to your tolerable time, tafy will notify you to leave. Till then you can carry on your work, without hitting maps site/app again & again.

Tafy's size is to small, it takes very very very less RAM compared to site/app. Which will result in better performance of your PC and eventually smoothing your work.

This was the brief overview of what I build last week in the same category as of [wimator](./wimator)

## Features of Tafy

- Easy to setup

  - Download it from [chrome webstore](http://bit.ly/tafy).
  - Open [Google maps](http://bit.ly/v-maps)
  - Search for the destination.
  - Click on directions.
  - See the magic.

  Now you can close maps tab. Tafy is ready to do it's job.
  It will automatically update travel time on it's badge.

- Fully customizable

  - Refersh rate can be adjusted.
    It is the time interval in which travel time is updated from the server.
    If in case you are not very keen to go home, you can increase refresh rate. Just to keep an eye on traffic. Otherwise reduce it.

  - Set your travel mode
    You can select your travel mode (driving, walking, cycling or transit). Tafy will fetch travel time according to it. Changing travel mode is too simple, just tap on respective radio buttons.

- Get notified when travel time drops to
  Set the time duration in which you are ready to travel. And Tafy will notify you if time drops to that.

- Add as much routes you want
  Just search for directions on [Google maps](http://bit.ly/v-maps) and Tafy will automatically add for you. In future you can easily select another destination without opening [Google maps](http://bit.ly/v-maps).

- Get travel time via all possible routes
  Tap on Tafy icon in the extensions section on chrome and all the routes with distance and directions will be listed under the section of **Travel Route**

- Easy on/off buttons
  Are you on a vacations? Simply toggle the switch.

Don't forget to try it. Looking forward for your feedback and comments.
