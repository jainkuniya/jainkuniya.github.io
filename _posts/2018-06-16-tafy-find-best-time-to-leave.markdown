Holla! Glad that you came here :p

Traffic, Traffic, Traffic!
Are you facing problems with traffic?

- Worried about when to leave, to meet minimal traffic?
- Checking Google maps frequently to keep an eye on the traffic?

Then this is for you :)

[**Tafy**](http://bit.ly/tafy) - Magical chrome extension which helps in finding best time to leave for the destination.

Let's understand it with a real life example:

You are sitting in the office and it is around ~7:30 PM. Fortunately this time you have completed all your work before time, and your product delivery is out with no incident reported. And your boss is extremely happy with it.

Now it's already time to go home, but as soon as you check map and it is hell lot of traffic

> OMG! It is too much traffic and raining too, let's wait and check again in another 5 mins.

And at least for next half an hour your primary job has shifted to check maps over and over again.

> You know what, you could have had played TT in that time :D How?

Let's take [Tafy's](http://bit.ly/tafy) help. Just trun it on, set the time duration which works for you, [Tafy's](http://bit.ly/tafy) will automatically notify you the best time to start. Till then, you can carry on your work (yes yes! you can play too :p), without needing to hit maps repeatedly.

[Tafy](http://bit.ly/tafy) is very light weight, it takes negligible RAM compared to map site/app which means it can just cozily sit there in your browser's top right corner without hampering any performance of your PC.

This was the brief overview of what I have build last week in the same category as of [wimator](../wimator)

## Features of [Tafy](http://bit.ly/tafy)

- **Easy to setup**

  - Open [Google maps](http://bit.ly/v-maps)
  - Search for the destination.
  - Click on directions.
  - See the magic.

  Now you can close maps tab. [Tafy](http://bit.ly/tafy) is ready to do it's job.
  It will automatically update travel time on it's badge.

- **Fully customizable**

  - **Get notified when travel time drops to your required time**

    Set the time duration in which you are ready to travel.

  - **Set your own custom text to be voiced in the notification.**

    Yes! you heard it right :). [Tafy](http://bit.ly/tafy) will play a audio of whatever text you have entered in the input box.

  - **Add as many routes you want**

    Just search for directions on [Google maps](http://bit.ly/v-maps) and [Tafy](http://bit.ly/tafy) will automatically add for you. In future you can easily select another destination without opening [Google maps](http://bit.ly/v-maps).

  - **Get travel time via all possible routes**

    Tap on [Tafy](http://bit.ly/tafy) icon in the extensions section on chrome and all the routes with distance and directions will be listed under the section of **Travel Route**.

    Are you on a vacations? Simply toggle the switch.

  - **Set your travel mode**

    You can select your travel mode (driving, walking, cycling or transit). [Tafy](http://bit.ly/tafy) will fetch travel time according to it. Changing travel mode is too simple, just tap on respective radio buttons.

  - **Adjustable Refresh rate**

    It is the time interval in which travel time is updated from the server.
    If, in case, it's not urgent to leave, you can increase the refresh rate to reduce the load on server :D.

Sounds useful? [Try](http://bit.ly/tafy) it out. Looking forward to your feedback and comments.
