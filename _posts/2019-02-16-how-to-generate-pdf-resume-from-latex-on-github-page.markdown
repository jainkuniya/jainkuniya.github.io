_Everyone learn new stuff daily, achieve something new every day, builds new innovative projects now and then and definitely wants to mention them in their resume._ 

But with current tools, the process of updating resume is too time-consuming and most of us avoid until we are looking for a new job ðŸ˜‰. And this experience is even worse for those who maintain resume in latex.
Either setup tex environment locally ([3gb MacTex for Mac](http://www.tug.org/mactex/)) or use third party online sites.  

I am also the one who prefers latex resume. So for every single small change, I have to either rely on online sites like [Sharelatex](https://www.sharelatex.com/). Update `Tex` file there, download code and generated pdf and then upload back to [my GitHub page repo](https://jainkuniya.github.io). Another option for me was to set up [MacTex](http://www.tug.org/mactex/) locally. But having 128GB Mac, I can't manage to devote 3gb to this.

So to make this process seamless, I have developed [BotLatexx](https://botlatexx.github.io/). 
With this no extra work needs to be done in order to maintain an updated copy of your resume on GitHub pages, just make changes on `Tex` file locally and push it to GitHub repo. [BotLatexx](https://botlatexx.github.io/) will take care of everything for you.

**How it works**

In simple words, it builds your latex project on the cloud and returns your generated PDF.


Here is the user flow:
- You edit your `Tex` file locally.
- Push your code to GitHub repo.
- Check your resume URL, it will consist of your changes. It's MAGIC, it's MAGIC
