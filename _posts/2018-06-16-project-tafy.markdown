## Developer's note

Recently I moved to Banglore for my summer internship at Goibibo, where I witnessed the world famous traffic and people investing average half an hour on a daily basis by refreshing maps to find out best time to leave for their destination hence I decided to develop this chrome extension which eases this for you.

For more info find my blog on [Tafy](https://jainkuniya.github.io/tafy-find-best-time-to-leave/);
