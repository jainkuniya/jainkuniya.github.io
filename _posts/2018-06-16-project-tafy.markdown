## Developer's note

Recently I joined Goibibo for my summer intern, and I realized the problem of hitting maps again & again to find when the traffic is mininal. So I thought of developing this chrome extension which do jobs for you and you can focus on your work.

For more info find my blog on [Tafy](https://jainkuniya.github.io/tafy-find-best-time-to-leave/);
