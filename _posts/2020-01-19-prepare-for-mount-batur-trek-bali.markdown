description: Looking for a trek in Bali? Here is all the information you need to know before you start.
---

In my last trip to Bali, I went to **Mount Batur Sunrise trek**. In this blog post I am going to tell you all the details you need to know for the trek.

**Mount batur** is situated in the North-East part of the Bali, in [Kintamani](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kintamani,+Bangli+Regency,+Bali,+Indonesia/@-8.2499984,115.2749539,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x2dd1f46fa4effc21:0x4030bfbca7d2c20!8m2!3d-8.2573896!4d115.3548713) village. There are multiple points to start the trek. The most famous one is sunrise trek. It is around ~81KM from [Ngurah Rai International Airport (Bali airport)](<https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Ngurah+Rai+International+Airport+(DPS),+Jalan+Raya+Gusti+Ngurah+Rai,+Tuban,+Badung+Regency,+Bali,+Indonesia/Mount+Batur+Sunrise+Trekking+Starting+Point,+Jl.+Bukit+Mekar+Sari,+Songan+A,+Kintamani,+Bangli+Regency,+Bali+80652,+Indonesia/@-8.4937193,115.142884,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x2dd2441650216933:0xdf71da6ddd7bcc1f!2m2!1d115.166787!2d-8.7467172!1m5!1m1!1s0x2dd24733aef83e13:0x1d61e0b3949f653d!2m2!1d115.3944304!2d-8.2408772>).

There are many tour packages which offer this trek, they will pick you up from your hotels at around 2-3AM, followed by trek, breakfast at the top and again back to hotel in the afternoon. They also provide a guide which will take care of you on the way.

**What we did?** We landed at [Bali airport](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ngurah+Rai+International+Airport/@-8.7467172,115.1645983,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x2dd2441650216933:0xdf71da6ddd7bcc1f!8m2!3d-8.7467172!4d115.166787) at 02:10AM, then took the cab to the [starting point](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mount+Batur+Sunrise+Trekking+Starting+Point/@-8.2408772,115.3922417,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x2dd24733aef83e13:0x1d61e0b3949f653d!8m2!3d-8.2408772!4d115.3944304). It was a ~2 hr drive. You can easily get [GoJek](https://www.gojek.com/) or [Grab](https://www.grab.com/sg/) or local Taxi. I would suggest you to either take GoJek or Grab because local Taxi will ask for more money ad being foreigner, and you will have to negotiate. Also you will not be familiar with local language. GoJek/Grab will charge you around ~450.000 IDR.

On the way, there was some guy who was collecting 30,000 IDR per person on the way to starting point. This was few kilometers away from the point. Nobody checked this ticket, you can avoid this.

After reaching to the point, we asked Cab driver to talk to local residence for a guide. He asked for 700.000 IDR. This was way to high, and might contain his comission as well. So we refused, and found a girl who agreed in 250.000 IDR.

It was around 3:40AM, and we started the trek. It was full moon night so path was visible. Torch was provided by the guide, which helped a lot on the way. The way is almost straight, only few divergence.

There are few shops on the way, for water bottles/cold drinks. But the price is more than 2x (around ~70.000 IDR), it gets on increase as you move forward.

We took some Apples, and eat it while treking. I advice you take some fruits with you.

We keep on moving forward, there were people from all over the world treking with us. I meet some people from Korea, Mauritius.

Actually the point where car drops you, at the starting point of the trek is already at some height. There is village at down. So after few minutes of trek, you can get some views like

The way was not so steep, it is easy to moderate level. There is also bike service which takes around 1000.000IDR to 2000.000IDR, totally depends on your negotiation. If you are taking bike service, please make sure to hold your hands tight with the rider. If you fell down, you will get hurt hardly.

It was around 05:30AM, and sun started rising. The view was like this

On following the path with fellow trekkers, you will finally reach a point where the bike services stop. From this point, the way is steep, full of rocks.

It will take around 15-20 mins from this point to reach the top of the Mount Batur.

We were fortunate we reach at the top by the time sunrise. The winds were mind blowing. And the view was superb ❤️.

There are few more hill tops nearby, if you wish you can take some more time and and visit them as well.

This is the village I was talking about, whose light looks fabulous while going up.

It was around 07:00AM we started to go down back. It was easy, actually you run just you need to maintain body balance.

Now the interesting part kicks in, as we are close to reach bottom base. Our guide asked for her fee which was 250.000IDR. We gave it.
Actually we were late while coming back, sun was all most top at 09:00AM.

After reaching base camp, there was no body except few local guys. And no cabs/transport service to catch highway. There was a person and a car, whose tyre was broken. This person kept on saying wait for few minutes, car driver is coming. As while starting trek, we told our GoJek driver not to wait so he went. Now we had no option to take.

For few minutes we waited for the driver, then found some suspisious activity from this guy. He was keep on calling a number on his phone. So we decided to walk with the help of directions in the Google Maps. First this guy was not allowing us to leave. But we kept on insisting that we will manage. And then this started asking for the trek fee around 700.000IDR by showing fake tickets. We refused to it. Also at this point of time our lady guide was accepting that she has recevied money from us. They were having some conversation in local language.

We decided to walk, there were no proper roads. I rembered the way while coming, so it was easy but the problem was you need to walk at an unknown place. Most of the people also don't know English. While walking we got one farmer, who can only understand "highway", he took us to the main road. Then we saw board of the ab service. While taking to the can driver, man came and started asking for money. This was a same man to whom we have refued for guide while going up. As we have taken the cab, so this can driver helped from this guy and saved our money. Otherwise we would have paid unnecessary money.

Actually this main road also had a way to start trek, you don't need to go interior in the village like we did.

**If you are planing to go there, be catious. Don't give money without proper investigation, if someone asks of some fee or something.**

Overall exprience was very good. If you love treking, then this trek is for you. If is of moderate dificulty, I would suggest it got begginers as well.

Then we went to few more places, like [Bali Handara Gate](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ACYBGNR70ODK3wr5_fV0bcwwCsmp3ElvFg%3A1580583817263&ei=ics1XsHmD_qe4-EP87WjsAQ&q=handara+gate+bali&oq=handara+gate+bali&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0j0i7i30l3j0j0i7i30j0l4.4802.5722..5956...0.3..0.150.973.0j7......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71j0i7i10i30.1tnOzEtQthg&ved=0ahUKEwiBz9zHhbHnAhV6zzgGHfPaCEYQ4dUDCAs&uact=5#). I will write another blog post in this series to share my first Bali trip.

Till then have a good time.
